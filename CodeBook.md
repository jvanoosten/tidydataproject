Description of the Data 
-----------------------

The raw data for the project was taken from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S 
smartphone.  A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The actual data for the project was download from here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Information about the feature variables was drawn from the featues_info.txt file provided in the raw data and is provided here again for convenience:

>The features come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

>Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

>Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

>These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The raw data was then transformed resulting data tidy data set with the average of each variable 
for each activity and each subject.  The data table is written as the tidydata.txt.   The data is in 
the wide form as outlined in this [thread](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-015/forum/thread?thread_id=27).  

The data satisifies the principles of tidy data where:

1. Each variable you measure shoud be in one column
2. Each different observation of that variable shoud be in a different row
3. There should be one table for each "kind" of variable
4. If you have multiple tables, they should include a column in the table
that allows them to be linked.  We only have a single table in this case.

Transformations Performed to Clean Up the Data
----------------------------------------------

The transformations included:

1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.  That included adding the columns for the subjects and activities.
2. Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted. 
3. Descriptive activity names where applied to the activities in the data set.
4. Labels for the measurements were updated to removed invalid characters, remove mistakes (BodyBody), 
and show these were averages of averages and standard deviations.

Explicit details of the transformations are included in the README.md
